==================================================
## Seeking Participants for a Web-based Research Study on Teamwork

I am Sangwon Seo, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Rice University working with Prof. Vaibhav Unhelkar. We are seeking participants for a research study on collecting data of teamwork. The study will be conducted remotely (over the internet) and last around 25 minutes. If you are interested, please let me know (by sending an email to <sangwon.seo@rice.edu>) so we can send the link to the experiment webpage and create your ID for the experiment.

### Purpose of the Study
The quality of teamwork varies widely among teams and heavily depends on the shared understanding between the teammates. Our goal is to develop an AI coach that can assess and improve the quality of teamwork by observing team behavior. Through this experiment, we will collect data of teamwork, which will be used to develop and evaluate the AI coach.

### Experiment Procedure
During the study, you will be asked to complete collaborative tasks in simulated environments (much like a video game) and answer questions regarding the task.

### Participant Requirements
The participant of this study should be:
1. At least 18 years old;
2. Proficient in English; and
3. Able to give valid informed consent.

### Compensation
Participants that complete the experiment will receive a $5 Amazon gift card. In addition, the person with the highest cumulative score will receive an additional gift card worth $5.
