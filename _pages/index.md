Hi, there! Thanks for visiting my website.

I'm a Ph.D student in Computer Science working with [Dr. Vaibhav Unhelkar](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/vaibhav-unhelkar).
Main theme of my research is improving human-AI teaming with computational and learning-based methods.
Techincally, my work revolves around combining human knowledge with machine learning especially for tasks with small training dataset and incorporating models of human intelligence and behavior with aritificial intelligence so that AI agents can be more human-centric.
