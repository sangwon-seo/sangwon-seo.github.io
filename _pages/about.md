### Hello!
I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://cs.rice.edu/), currently working with [Dr. Vaibhav Unhelkar](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/vaibhav-unhelkar). I received my M.S. degree in Bioengineering and my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), South Korea. Prior to joining [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), I worked as a research engineer at [Coreline Soft](https://www.corelinesoft.com/en/) - a medical AI startup - and [the Agency for Defense Development](https://www.add.re.kr/eps) - a national research institute - in South Korea. 

My research centers on **Human-Robot Collaboration**, **Human-Centered AI** and **Human Behavior Modeling**.
Specifically, I am interested in:
- Modeling human behavior to develop more human-centric AI agents; 
- Leveraging human knowledge in machine learning to enable training with limited data; and 
- Complementing AI and human intelligence to enhance human-human and human-AI teamwork.
