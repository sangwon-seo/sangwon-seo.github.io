## About
I'm a Ph.D student in [Computer Science](https://cs.rice.edu/) working with [Dr. Vaibhav Unhelkar](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/vaibhav-unhelkar). I received M.S. degree in Bioengineering and B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), South Korea. Before joining Rice, I worked as a research engineer at [Coreline Soft](https://www.corelinesoft.com/) - a medical software start-up - and [Agency for Defense Development](https://www.add.re.kr/eps) in South Korea. 

Main theme of my research is improving human-AI teaming with computational and learning-based approaches.
Technically, I am interested in modeling human behavior to enable AI agents to make decisions more human-centric and human-like; leveraging human knowledge in machine learning to be able to train models on small data; and developing optimal intervention strategies that combine both artificial intelligence and human intelligence to enhance human-human and human-AI teamwork.
