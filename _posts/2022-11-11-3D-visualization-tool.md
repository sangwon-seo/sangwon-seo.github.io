This video shows a 3D visualization tool I developed to extract key features—such as the 3D positions of surgical tools and pegs—from a depth camera. While Intel provides a native viewer for the RealSense Depth Camera, it was insufficient for research purposes, as I couldn't overlay the results of my algorithm on it. My tool, implemented using Qt and OpenGL, enables interactive, real-time visualization of algorithmic results through mouse and keyboard controls.
